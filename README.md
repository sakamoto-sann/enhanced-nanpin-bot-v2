## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimer

This trading bot is designed for educational and research purposes. Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss. The "permanent accumulation" strategy means positions are never sold, which can lead to significant losses during extended bear markets. 

**Key Risks**:
- **Liquidation Risk**: Leveraged positions can be liquidated
- **Permanent Losses**: No selling means no profit realization
- **Market Risk**: Crypto markets are highly volatile
- **Technical Risk**: API failures, bugs, or connectivity issues
