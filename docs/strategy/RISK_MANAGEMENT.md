## Optimization Questions for Gemini AI

### 1. Optimal Trade Frequency Analysis

**Question**: What is the mathematically optimal trade frequency for a leveraged DCA strategy?

**Context**:
- 296 trades = too frequent (diluted returns)
- 6 trades = too infrequent (missed opportunities)
- Need sweet spot for maximum opportunity capture

**Request**: Analyze the relationship between:
- Trade frequency and capital efficiency
- Market volatility and optimal entry intervals
- Leverage multiplier and position frequency
- Optimal cooldown periods between entries

**Expected Answer**: Specific range (e.g., 15-25 trades per year, or 1-2 trades per month)

### 2. Entry Criteria Optimization

**Current Thresholds**:
- Drawdown threshold: Testing -30% vs smaller dips
- Fear & Greed threshold: Testing <10 vs <35
- Fibonacci selectivity: All levels vs focused on deeper retracements

**Questions for AI**:
1. **Minimum Drawdown Threshold**: What's the optimal BTC drawdown percentage to trigger entries?
   - Option A: -20% (more frequent, smaller opportunities)
   - Option B: -30% (less frequent, larger opportunities)  
   - Option C: Dynamic threshold based on volatility regime

2. **Fear & Greed Optimization**: What Fear & Greed Index level provides best risk/reward?
   - Current testing: <10 (extreme fear) vs <35 (fear)
   - Request: Optimal threshold with historical backtesting evidence

3. **Fibonacci Level Selection**: Which levels offer best risk-adjusted returns?
   - Question: Should we skip 23.6% (weak level) and focus on 38.2%+ ?
   - Golden Ratio Focus: Is 61.8% the most profitable level historically?
   - Deep Value: Does 78.6% provide best leverage opportunities?

### 3. Position Sizing Optimization

**Current Fibonacci Multipliers**:
- 23.6%: 1x base position
- 38.2%: 2x base position  
- 50.0%: 3x base position
- 61.8%: 5x base position (Golden ratio)
- 78.6%: 8x base position (extreme opportunity)

**Optimization Questions**:

1. **Leverage Scaling**: How should leverage scale with drawdown severity?
   - -20% drawdown: 5x leverage?
   - -40% drawdown: 10x leverage?
   - -60% drawdown: 20x leverage?

2. **Fear & Greed Position Sizing**: How should position size correlate with Fear & Greed levels?
   - Fear & Greed 0-10: Maximum multiplier?
   - Fear & Greed 10-20: Moderate multiplier?
   - Fear & Greed 20-35: Minimum multiplier?

3. **Fibonacci Importance Weighting**: Should position sizes follow Fibonacci sequence or mathematical optimization?
   - Current: 1x, 2x, 3x, 5x, 8x (Fibonacci sequence)
   - Alternative: Optimize based on historical hit rates and profitability

### 4. Timing and Cooldown Optimization

**Current Challenge**: Balance between opportunity capture and overtrading

**Questions for AI Analysis**:

1. **Optimal Cooldown Period**: What's the ideal time between trades?
   - Prevent overtrading during high volatility
   - Ensure sufficient capital for next opportunity
   - Account for leverage unwinding time

2. **Market Regime Awareness**: How should timing adapt to market conditions?
   - Bull market: Longer cooldowns (fewer opportunities)
   - Bear market: Shorter cooldowns (more opportunities)
   - Sideways market: Medium cooldowns

3. **Macro Event Integration**: How should timing respond to macro events?
   - Fed meetings: Increase/decrease frequency?
   - Major economic releases: Adjust cooldown periods?
   - Black swan events: Emergency protocols?
